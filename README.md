The latest medical research and clinical practice have shown that the effectiveness of existing anti-cancer drugs is highly dependent on the genomic
characteristics of patients. This implies that the same anti-cancer drugs may
have vastly different efficacy for different patients suffering from the same
cancer due to their distinct genomic features.
Existing systems face limitations in the availability and quality of comprehensive gene expression and drug response datasets, which can impact the
model generalizability. Some systems focus on short-term drug responses,
neglecting long-term effects and potential drug resistance.
Predicting anticancer drug response using gene expression is a cutting-edge
research area in the field of oncology and precision medicine. This study
aims to develop predictive models that leverage gene expression profiles to
determine how individual cancer patients will respond to specific anticancer
drugs. By analyzing gene expression patterns, biomarkers associated with
drug response or resistance can be identified, enabling personalized and targeted therapies for patients. The study involves the integration of advanced
computational methods, bioinformatics tools, and large-scale gene expression
datasets. The ultimate goal is to enhance cancer treatment efficacy, minimize
adverse effects, and contribute to the advancement of personalized medicine.
